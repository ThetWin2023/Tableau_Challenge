In this project we built Tableau dashboards to relay information about the Citi Bike data from New York City, along with Pandas programming in Jypyter Notebook ("citibike_data.ipynb")  to conduct Data Engineering.


About the Data

Since 2013, the Citi Bike Program has implemented a robust infrastructure for collecting data on the program’s utilization. Through the team’s efforts, each month bike data is collected, organized, and made public on the Citi Bike Data webpage.
Analysis for this project is based on 2024 Citi Bike Data.

*Please note that May 2024 data is not avialble. Therefore May has been excluded from the reports and analysis.


# Key Findings:
## The heavist traffic is observed in the month of July. This could be the result of the month being the hottest month in the summer and patrons enjoying riding in the warm weather rather than driving their cars.
